## Why sx?

Your best developers have figured out how to make AI assistants incredibly productive - custom skills, MCP configs, slash commands, proven patterns. But that knowledge is stuck on their machines.

**Current workarounds don't scale:**
- **Copy into each repo** - Duplication nightmare, no central updates, version drift
- **Global config** - Bloats context for projects/tasks that don't need those skills
- **Client plugins** - Manually install each one, locked to one AI client, no bundling

**sx solves this by:**
- **Sharing expertise** - Turn individual discoveries into team assets
- **Instant onboarding** - New devs inherit the team's AI playbook on day one
- **Central updates** - Change once in your vault, everyone gets the update
- **Scoped installation** - Right assets for each repo, no context bloat
- **Works with any AI client** - Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Kiro, and more

## Quickstart

**Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
brew tap sleuth-io/tap
brew install sx
```

**Or via shell script:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleuth-io/sx/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then

```bash
# Initialize
sx init

# Add an asset from your vault
sx add /path/to/my-skill

# Install assets to your current project
sx install
```

**Multiple vaults?** Use profiles to switch between them:

```bash
sx profile add work        # Add a new profile
sx profile use work        # Switch to it
sx profile list            # See all profiles
```

### Already using Claude Code?

If you've built up skills, plugins, or MCP configs in your `.claude` directory, `sx` helps you version, sync across machines, and share with teammates.

```bash
# Add your existing skills/commands (sx auto-detects the type)
sx add ~/.claude/commands/my-command
sx add ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
sx add code-review@claude-plugins-official
```

Your prompt files stay exactly as they are - `sx` just wraps them with metadata for versioning.

## What can you build and share?

- **Skills** - Custom prompts and behaviors for specific tasks
- **Rules** - Coding standards and guidelines that apply to specific file types or paths
- **Agents** - Autonomous AI agents with specific goals
- **Commands** - Slash commands for quick actions
- **Hooks** - Automation triggers for lifecycle events
- **MCP Servers** (experimental) - Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for external integrations
- **Plugins** - Claude Code plugin bundles with commands, skills, and more

## skills.sh support

sx integrates with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh), a community directory of 85k+ agent skills.

```bash
sx add anthropics/skills/frontend-design  # Add a specific skill
sx add vercel-labs/agent-skills           # Browse skills in a repo
sx add --browse                           # Search and browse the full directory
```

## Distribution models

Choose the right distribution model for your team:

### Local (Personal)

Perfect for easily sharing personal tools across multiple personal projects

```bash
sx init --type path --path my/vault/path
```

### Git vault (Small teams)

Share assets through a shared git vault

```bash
sx init --type git --repo git@github.com:yourteam/skills.git
```

### Skills.new (Large teams and enterprise)

Centralized management with a UI for discovery, creation, sharing, and usage analytics

```bash
sx init --type sleuth
```

## How it works

sx uses a lock file (like package-lock.json) for deterministic installations across your team:

1. **Create** assets with metadata (name, version, dependencies)
2. **Share** to your vault
3. **Install** [globally, per project, or even per path](docs/scoping.md) (monorepo support!)
4. **Auto-install** on new Claude Code sessions
5. **Stay synchronized** - everyone gets the same tools automatically
